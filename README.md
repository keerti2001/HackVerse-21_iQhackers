This app is minor implementation of our understanding of Liquidity Mining. This is a Decentralised Finance Application that works similar to bank, where basically a user can deposit cryptocurrency into the application and while it is deposited , the user will earn interest (Staking)
This app allows three functions:-
1)Stake tokens
2)Unstake tokens 
3)Issue tokens
In this application we have used real-world cryptocurrency,Dai(DAI), this is a stable cryptocurrency related to US dollars so the price remains consistent. 
This app allows user to deposit DAI and earn tokens.


## Working
Frontend - HTML,JavaScript(ReactJS),CSS (UI/UX of the app)
Smart Contracts - Solidity (This allows us to stake token to applications and reward users new token for using app)
