This app is the minor implementation of our understanding of Liquidity Mining. This is a Decentralised Finance Application that works similar to a bank, where basically a user can deposit cryptocurrency into the application and while it is deposited, the user will earn interest (Staking).

This app allows three functions:-
1) Stake tokens - The process of putting the tokens from the user account to stake balance.
2) Unstake tokens - The process of putting back the stake tokens back into the user account balance
3) Issue tokens - The process of putting crytpocurrency tokens in user account

In this application we have used real-world cryptocurrency, Dai(DAI), this is a stable cryptocurrency related to US dollars so the price remains consistent. This app allows users to deposit DAI and earn tokens.


## Working
We cannot use tradional webste system for using cryptocurrency as there is a chance of improper fiddling with the crptocurrency balance by owner,i.e. there is a chance that the account balance can be changed maliciously. Hence the use of Ethereum Smart Contracts ensures such safety of account balance and cryptocurrencies. 
1) Frontend - HTML,JavaScript(ReactJS),CSS (UI/UX of the app)
2) Smart Contracts - Solidity (This allows us to stake token to applications and reward users new token for using app)
